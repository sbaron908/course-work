## Basic Concepts of FrontEnd Development

We have 3 main programming languages involved:

 1. HTML
 2. CSS
 3. JavaScript

 ## HTML

  - User enters a `URL` in the browser address bar -> ENTER
  - Browser sends a __HTTP Request__ to a server: domain address inside the URL
  - Server processes the request and sends back __HTTP Response__
  - The main part of the response is its body which is a html string
  - Browser recives the html response and starts rendering it:
    - it checks the DOC type to get the HTML Standard version : HTML5 usually
    - Parses the string to a Document Object Model
    - DOM: head and a body
    - Browser shows an empty page and doesnt render anything during the process of going tthrought the head
    - Browser oes for the body
